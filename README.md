# 🌟 Hospitality Domain 0.1 - AtliQ Grands

## Project Overview 🏨  
AtliQ Grands operates multiple five-star hotels across India and has been a key player in the hospitality industry for over 20 years. However, due to strategic challenges from competitors and ineffective management decisions, they have been losing market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotel segment.  

As part of their strategy to regain market share, the managing director decided to implement "Business and Data Intelligence" insights. Since AtliQ Grands lacks an in-house data analytics team, their revenue management team hired a third-party data analyst (me 💻) to analyze historical data and provide actionable insights.  

This is the initial version (0.1) of the project, showcasing a comprehensive Power BI dashboard with insights that help AtliQ Grands make informed decisions to address their challenges.
